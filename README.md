# Expressibility-and-Scott-entanglement-measure-for-Parameterized-Quantum-Circuits
This repository has most of the codes I applied during my master's. I present some numerical calculations of expressibility, Scott entanglement measure 1 and 2 and t-designs estimation for different parameterized quantum circuits.
